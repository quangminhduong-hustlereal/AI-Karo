Create a Tic-tac-toe (Caro) console game using the Rich library in Python with the following specifications:

1. Game Mode: Player vs AI
2. Requirements:
   - Implement a command-line interface using Rich library
   - Create a dynamic game board display
   - Support player moves via keyboard input
   - Develop an AI opponent using minimax algorithm
   - Show game status (current player, scores, moves)
   - Handle invalid moves and edge cases

3. Core Features:
   - 10x10 game board visualization
   - Alternating turns between human player and AI
   - Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns
   - Clear move indicators and game state feedback
   - Option to restart or quit the game
- Win Condition:
    - A player wins if they have 5 consecutive marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the 10x10 board.
    - The game ends immediately when a win is detected.
    - If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

4. Technical Guidelines:
   - Use Rich's Table component for the game board
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Ensure responsive AI moves
   - Add color coding for different players
   - Include basic game statistics

Please provide a Python implementation following these requirements while ensuring clean code organization and user-friendly interaction.
